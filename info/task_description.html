<p>“Oh, darn this thing.” Sofia grumbled banging her communicator device on the table.</p>
<p>Nikola looked up from the Hexagonal Circuit. “What’s wrong?” he walked over to where she was standing.</p>
<p>“The ship just sent me a message about something. I don’t really know what it was about though because this blasted thing won’t work. UGH this mega-bytes!”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t overload there. Let me take a look... Sofia... You haven’t updated the encryption keys. You need to be running com-patch 7.11.89 and you’re running 5.6.13. Didn’t you get the emails I sent you about the updates?”</p>
<p>“Well... Nooooot exactly... They may have been encrypted too...”</p>
<p>“That’s why you keep asking to borrow my communications pad!” Interrupted Stephen.</p>
<p>“SIGH. Okay Sofia, I’m going to help you sort this out...”</p>

<p>The robots use a very simple, symmetric cipher with a key for their correspondence. The text contains only letters (lowercase) and whitespaces. Each character is assigned a number that corresponds to its order in the alphabet (a whitespace=0). The secret key is a word that is translated into a sequence of numbers. That key is then applied to the text blocks. </p>

<p>For encryption, the value of the first letter in the block is added to the first letter in the secret key and modulo 27 (finds the remainder of division by 27). This is repeated for all of the letters in the block.</p>
<p>For decryption, the value of the first letter in the block is reduced by the first letter in the secret key; if it is a negative number, add 27 to it. The secret key is used throughout the text blocks cyclically. After decryption, the sequence of numbers is translated into text.</p>

Sofia does not have the current key, and has come across a new encrypted message. She still has the old encrypted and decrypted messages so using these, you must try to decrypt the new message.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input</strong>: A list of three strings: old encrypted text, old decrypted text, new encrypted text.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output</strong>: The string of the new decrypted text.
